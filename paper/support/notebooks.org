*** Notebooks
Notebooks are interactive systems for a user to interact with a
programming or statistical analysis engine.  Notebooks support the
co-mingling of code and results in a single document and some
notebooks provide for exportation of the document to various formats.

Notebooks are characterized by a single linear session consisting of a
series of commands being submitted to the engine and the engine
returning results.  While notebooks may provide features aimed at
integrating their results into published works they are not document
authoring environments.

Examples of notebook software include
- Matlab [fn:9]
- Sage Math [fn:10]
