#+LaTeX: \begin{abstract}
We present a new computing environment for authoring mixed natural and
computer language documents. In this environment a single
hierarchically-organized plain text source file may contain a variety
of elements such as code in arbitrary programming languages, raw data,
links to external resources, project management data, working notes,
and text for publication. Code fragments may be executed in situ with
graphical and text output captured in, or linked to, the file. Export
to LaTeX, HTML, Beamer, DocBook and other formats permits working
reports, presentations and manuscripts for publication to be generated
from the file. In addition, code extraction (tangling) permits
functioning pure code files to be extracted from the file. This
environment is implemented as an extension to the Emacs text editor
and provides a rich set of features for authoring both prose and code,
as well as sophisticated project management capabilities.
#+LaTeX: \end{abstract}

* Introduction
There are a variety of settings in which it is desirable to mix prose
and code in a single container.
- /Scientific research/ increasingly involves the use of computational
  tools, the inclusion of which is vital to successful communication
  and verification of research results.
- In /software development/ the exchange of ideas is accomplished
  through both shared code and prose; code provides 
  concrete and succinct description and prose provides higher level
  explanation.  Without proper documentation the usability and future
  extensibility of computational tools are severely compromised.
- In /pedagogical/ environments it is important for descriptions of
  algorithms or techniques to go hand-in-hand with concrete
  implementations.  These environments range from in-class
  presentations with accompanying algorithmic implementations, to
  online tutorials or experiential blogs with accompanying
  instructions.

In each of the situations described above, prose alone in the absence of
code is typically insufficient.  Similarly, distribution of code
without expository prose is a less than ideal medium for communication
between people. In this paper we describe Babel, which provides a
unified environment that supports many different approaches to
composition and application of combined prose and code (Table
\ref{grid}).  Babel is implemented as part of the Org-mode plain text
markup language, which provides the high level structure of Babel
documents and many of export functions.  Babel and Org-mode are
designed for ease of use and adoption.  The Babel environment aims to
be a general solution for authoring projects with mixed computational
and natural languages.  It supports multiple languages, export
targets, and work flows.

# With Babel the entire life cycle of a research or development

# 
# I didn't quite understand the last part of the preceding sentence (Dan)
Here we review existing approaches to the combined authoring of prose
and code, including software tools designed to address one or more of
the use cases for mixed natural and computer language documents
(Section \ref{background}).  We then describe the design of Babel
(Section \ref{design}) and Org-mode (Section \ref{org-mode}), and
# This is the first mention of "Org-mode". Needs some prior
# introductory sentence.
demonstrate their application to some common use cases (Section
\ref{applications}).  We conclude with a discussion of why we believe
Babel constitutes a uniquely productive environment for authoring
mixed prose and code projects (Section \ref{points-for}), as well as
some limits of the current implementation and directions for future
work (Section \ref{future-work}).

* Background
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: background
  :END:
The combined authoring of prose and code has been historically
approached from two different standpoints.

- Literate Programming :: enhances traditional software development by
     embedding code in explanatory essays and encourages treating the
     act of development as one of communication with future
     maintainers.

- Reproducible Research :: embeds executable code in publications of
     scholarly work, with the aim of allowing the analysis described
     in the paper to be re-run by readers.

We discuss each of these approaches in turn including a review of
existing software tools that support each technique.

** Literate Programming
#+begin_quote
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human
beings what we want a computer to do.

\attrib{Donald E. Knuth}
#+end_quote

The technique of /literate programming/ was introduced by Donald Knuth
\cite{web} in the early 1980's, not long after his creation of the TeX
typesetting software.  The goals of literate programming are to
encourage the author of a computational work to approach the project
"as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence
of style". 
# need citation with page number

Accordingly, literate programming tools use input files that mix
sections of computer code with sections of natural language typically
marked up in TeX or LaTeX.  The literate programming tool then provides a
number of methods for the creation of two types of /view/ into the
document; articles intended for human consumption that consist of
typset prose and marked-up code blocks, and computer readable
documents of pure source code.  The literate programming terms for
generating these views are /weaving/ and /tangling/ respectively.  A
common feature of literate programming tools is the ability to
organize code blocks differently when /tangling/ and /weaving/ thereby
allowing the programmer to introduce concepts to humans in a different
order than code is introduced to the computer.

The original literate programming tool, developed by Knuth, was =WEB=,
which consists of two primary programs, =TANGLE= and =WEAVE=.  This
system supported the Pascal programming language and produced
documents typeset with TeX.  A modern descendent is =noweb=
\cite{noweb} which is designed to be language independent.  Its
primary programs, =notangle= and =noweave=, are both written in =C=.
Documents produced by =noweave= can be typeset with =TeX=, =LaTeX=,
and =troff= or displayed in a web browser as =HTML=.  Software tools
such as =WEB= and =noweb= enable the /authoring/ of both prose and
code, but do not provide facilities for the execution of code from
within documents.  Instead, code intended for execution is tangled and
the resulting source code files are sent to a compiler or interpreter.

** Reproducible Research
#+begin_quote
An article about computational science in a scientific publication is
*not* the scholarship itself, it is merely *advertising* of the
scholarship.  The actual scholarship is the complete software
development environment and complete set of instructions which
generated the figures.

\attrib{David L. Donoho}
#+end_quote

A research project typically produces one or more documents that
describe or rely upon:
  - a data collection
  - computations and code used in data analysis or simulation
  - methodological conventions and assumptions
  - decisions among alternate analytic paths

The documents produced by a research project typically stand apart
from the things they describe and rely upon, which makes it difficult
for other researchers to understand fully or to reproduce the results
of the research project.
 
A software solution to this problem was proposed by Gentleman and
Temple Lang, who "introduce the concept of a /compendium/ as both a
container for the different elements that make up the document and its
computations (i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for
distributing, managing and updating the collection."  They
summarize the uses and implications of a compendium:

  - it encapsulates the actual work of the author, not just an
    abridged version suitable for publication; 

  - it can display different levels of detail in /derived documents/; 

  - the computations included in it can be re-run by an interested
    reader, potentially with different inputs;

  - it contains explicit computational details that make it easier for
    an interested reader to adapt and extend the methods;

  - it enables programmatic construction of plots and tables; 

  - its components can be treated as data or inputs to software and
    manipulated programmatically in ways perhaps not envisioned by
    the author.

/Reproducible research/ thus approaches mixed natural and
computational language documents from a different direction than
literate programming.  Rather than adding prose to computational
projects, reproducible research seeks to augment publications of
scientific research with the computer code used during conduct of the
research.  Where literate programming tangles embedded code into an
external file used as input to a compiler or an interpreter, code
embedded in reproducible research is intended to be executed as part
of the document generation process.  In this way the data, analysis,
and figures supporting a publication can be generated from the
publication itself.

# The requirements of a tool supporting reproducible research are
# thoroughly explored by Gentleman and Temple Lang, and presented in the
# concept of a /compendium/ \cite{compendium}.  In their formulation a
# compendium is a container that holds the text, code, and raw data
# constituting a scholarly work.  Compendia are intended to facilitate
# the distribution, management, re-creation, and extension of such
# works.

# A compendium would also support a variety of different /views/, where
# /views/ are static documents automatically generated by /running/ the
# compendium.  Examples of views would be an article submitted for
# publication, or a presentation or lecture based on the work.

Gentleman and Temple Lang propose the adoption of compendia as the
new unit of peer review and distribution of scientific work.

#+begin_quote
The compendium concept, and that of reproducible research, has the
potential to improve the state of publication about computational
science. The tools we have proposed and discussed will allow us to
move from an era of advertisement to one where our scholarship itself
is published. This exposes the computations themselves to the
scientific method and enhances the potential for iterative refinement
and extension.

\attrib{Gentleman and Temple Lang}
#+end_quote

=Sweave= \cite{sweave} is a modern software tool, written in the =R=
statistical programming language, that can be used for reproducible
research.  =Sweave= (and the =R= community at large) inspired the work
that led to the /compendium/ idea.  The recent resurgence in
reproducible research owes much to the success of both =R= and
=Sweave=.  =Sweave= documents consist of code blocks of the =R=
statistical programming language embedded into LaTeX documents.  The
=R= functions that make up =Sweave= execute the embedded =R= code and
produce a LaTeX document that includes the resulting tables, graphical
figures, and inline results.  If the =Sweave= document is accompanied
by the data files used in the statistical computations along with any
=R= language files that are sourced, then the reader can trace a
result back to the relevant =R= computations and through to the
original data.

# It might be useful to start this section with Lisp and how bottom-up
# programming changes the language to suit the problem.  So emacs
# turned lisp into a language for writing editors, org-mode turned it
# into a language for parsing hierarchical documents, etc., and babel
# turned it into a language for literate programming and reproducible
# research. (no attempt to be precise or exhaustive here).
* Design
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: design
  :END:
At the core of Babel is the Emacs text editor and emacs-lisp,
a dialect of lisp that supports editing text documents.  Emacs has
been under development since the mid 1970s and is currently at
version 23.  Org-mode extends Emacs with a simple, yet powerful markup
language that turns it into a language for creating and parsing
hierarchically-organized text documents.  It was originally designed
for keeping notes, maintaining task lists, and planning
projects.  Its rich feature set includes text structuring, project
management, and a publishing system that can export to a variety of
formats.  Babel extends Org-mode by activating sections of Org-mode
documents, effectively distinguishing code and data blocks from text
sections.  Activation means that code and data blocks sections can be
/evaluated/ to return their contents or their computational results.
The results of code block evaluation can be written
to a named data block in the document, where it can be referred to by
other code blocks, any one of which can be written in a different
computing language.  In this way, an Org-mode buffer becomes a place
where different computer languages communicate with one another.  Like
Emacs, Babel is extensible: support for new languages can be added by
in a modular fashion through the definition of a small number of Emacs
Lisp functions.  Additionaly, generally useful code or data blocks can
be added to a "Library of Babel", from which they can be called by any
Org-mode document.

In the remainder of this section, we first introduce Org-mode,
focusing on those features that support the literate programming and
reproducible research capabilities of Babel (Section \ref{org-mode}).
We then describe the syntax of code and data blocks (Section
\ref{syntax}), evaluation of code blocks (Section \ref{code-blocks}),
weaving and tangling Org-mode documents (Section \ref{export}), and
Babel's language support facilities (Section \ref{languages}).

** Org-mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-mode
   :END:

Thank you Carsten!

- hierarchically structured text
- readable markup language
- export targets (html, latex, beamer, ascii)
- spreadsheets, tables links
- code blocks
- more?

** Code and Data Blocks
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: code-blocks
    :END:
Babel extends Org-mode with a naming convention that identifies code
or data blocks making them remotely callable.  In addition, the syntax
of Org-mode code blocks is extended to facilitate evaluation.  Babel
writes the results of source code evaluation to the document as
Org-mode constructs, and allows for code and data blocks to interact
through a simple but powerful variable passing system.

*** Syntax
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: syntax
    :END:
Babel recognizes Org-mode /tables/, /examples/, and /links/ as data
block content.  Data blocks which are preceded by a line that begins
with =#+results:=, followed by a name unique within the document can
be manipulated by Babel.  All data block types can be named in this
way.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+results: tabular-data
  ,| 1 |  2 |
  ,| 2 |  3 |
  ,| 3 |  5 |
  ,| 4 |  7 |
  ,| 5 | 11 |
  
  ,#+results: scalar-data
  ,: 9
  
  ,#+results: linked-data
  ,[[http://external-data.org]]
#+end_src

Babel marks active code blocks with a =#+srcname:= line, followed by a
name unique within the document.  It also augments Org-mode code
blocks with header aguments that control the way Babel handles
evaluation and export.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+srcname: <name>
  ,#+begin_src <language> <header arguments>
  ,  <body>
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

*** Evaluation
# Is this section the place to discuss <<noweb>> syntax?
# 
# no, I think we can leave out the discussion of noweb syntax, since
# we point to noweb as one of our references and we say later that we
# follow their model exactly (Eric)

Babel knows how to evaluate code written in a number of languages.  In
the evaluation of source code Babel makes use of a great deal of
existing Emacs support for interaction with languages running as both
external and inferior (Emacs-internal) processes.
# I used "interpreters" but this may be a technical term that is too restrictive (Dan)
# I removed "interpreters" because we also run compiled languages e.g. C (Eric)

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src ruby
  ,  require 'date'
  ,  "This block was last evaluated on #{Date.today}"
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

As an example the block of ruby code shown above would be evaluated by
1) writing its contents to a temporary file
2) using the =ruby= command to execute the file
3) capturing the return value of the code block

By default the captured output appears in the Org-mode buffer
immediately following the code block, resulting in the following
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src ruby
  ,  require 'date'
  ,  "This block was last evaluated on #{Date.today}"
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,: This block was last evaluated on 2010-06-25
#+end_src

The same code could also be evaluated in an interactive session
through adding a session /header argument/, e.g.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src ruby :session
  ,  require 'date'
  ,  "This block was last evaluated on #{Date.today}"
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src
in this case the code would be evaluated by
1) starting a persistent =ruby= process associated with a new Emacs
   buffer
2) passing the code body to that process
3) capturing the last value returned by that process

Session evaluation can be useful when the code block changes some
state the retention of which is desirable for manual inspection, or
for use by subsequent code blocks.  For example the first block of =R=
code below sets variables in an interactive session and the second
block of =R= code can access these variables because it is run in the
same =R= session (adapted from [fn::
http://www.stat.umn.edu/~charlie/Sweave/]).

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src R :session *R* :results silent
  ,  n <- 50
  ,  x <- seq(1, n)
  ,  a.true <- 3
  ,  b.true <- 1.5
  ,  y.true <- a.true + b.true * x
  ,  s.true <- 17.3
  ,  y <- y.true + s.true * rnorm(n)
  ,  out1 <- lm(y ~ x)
  ,  summary(out1)
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+begin_src R :session *R* :file fig.pdf
  ,  plot(x, y)
  ,  abline(out1)
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

Session-based evaluation is similar to the approach to evaluation
taken by =Sweave= in which every code block is evaluated in the same
persistent session---with the main difference being that Babel allows
for multiple disjoint named sessions.

*** Results
The previous example made use of two header arguments which we have
not discussed -- =results= and =file=.  Both of these arguments
control how the results of a code block are handled.  As seen in the
ruby evaluation example above, by default results of code blocks are
inserted as protected text immediately after the code block in the
Org-mode buffer.  In practice the user is given significant control
over the handling of code block results both during interactive
evaluation and during export.

There are two ways in which results can be collected from code blocks.
- =:results value= :: Specifies that the code block should be treated
     as a function, and the results should be equal to the value of
     the last expression in the blocks, like the return value of a
     function.  This is the default setting.  The following block
     demonstrates /value/ based result collection.
     #+begin_src org
       ,#+begin_src perl
       ,  $x = 8;
       ,  $x = $x + 1;
       ,  print "shouting into the dark!\n";
       ,  $x
       ,#+end_src
       
       ,#+results:
       ,: 9
     #+end_src
- =:results output= :: Specifies that the results should be collected
     from STDOUT, which allows code blocks to incrementally print
     their output as in the following.
     #+begin_src org
       ,#+begin_src python :results output
       ,  for x in ['Org-mode', 'Emacs']:
       ,      print x, len(x)
       ,#+end_src
       
       ,#+results:
       ,: Org-mode 8
       ,: Emacs 5
     #+end_src

Results can take a number of different forms.  So far we have only
seen string results, however it is possible for code blocks to return
vector results.  Babel recognizes vector results and inserts them as
tables into the Org-mode buffer as shown below.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src haskell
  ,  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
  
  ,#+begin_src haskell
  ,  zip [1..] (map (\ x -> x + 1) [1, 2, 3])
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,| 1 | 2 |
  ,| 2 | 3 |
  ,| 3 | 4 |
#+end_src

Additionally some code blocks may output files or images.  Babel is
able to save these types of results in external files, and then link
to these files from the Org-mode buffer.  In this way the resulting
files can be opened from within the document and included in exports.
For example the following =R= block which calls =plot= results in the
following link being inserted into the Org-mode buffer.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src R :session *R* :file fig.pdf
  ,  plot(x, y)
  ,  abline(out1)
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,[[file:fig.pdf]]
#+end_src

Much more information about controlling the evaluation of code and the
handling of code results is available in the Babel documentation.

*** Variables
We've now seen how data originating in code blocks can be incorporated
into Org-mode buffers in the form of /scalars/, /tables/ and /links/
to external files.  It is also possible for data to flow from each of
these containers (/scalars/, /tables/ and /links/) into code blocks,
and even for data to pass from code block to code block without ever
landing in the Org-mode buffer.

This is all made possible through a simple system of passing arguments
to code blocks.  Values passed to code blocks are then made accessible
from the source code in a language specific way, but most often in the
form of variables assigned to the values of the arguments.

The following syntax can be used to pass an argument to a code blocks.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+source: inc
  ,#+begin_src clojure :var x=10
  ,  (+ x 1)
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results: inc
  ,: 11
#+end_src

In the context of this code block the value of =x= is now set to 10.
We could also use a named value elsewhere in the buffer to initialize
a variable.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+results: remote-x
  ,: some text
  
  ,Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer
  ,adipiscing elit.
  
  ,#+begin_src clojure :var x=remote-x
  ,  x
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,: some text
#+end_src

As these examples demonstrate, strings will be passed in a strings,
numbers as numbers, and tables will be passed in as tables.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+results: table-x
  ,| 1 | 
  ,| 2 |
  ,| 3 |
  ,| 4 |
  ,| 5 |
  
  ,#+begin_src ruby :var x=table-x
  ,  x.map{|row| row.map{|cell| cell + 1}}
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,| 2 |
  ,| 3 |
  ,| 4 |
  ,| 5 |
  ,| 6 |
#+end_src

Code blocks can reference other code blocks.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+source: inc
  ,#+begin_src clojure :var x=10
  ,  (+ x 1)
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+begin_src python :var y=inc :results output
  ,  print "10 + 1 =", y
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,: 10 + 1 = 11
#+end_src

In addition arguments can be passed to referenced code blocks using a
traditional function syntax with named arguments.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src python :var y=inc(x=2) :results output
  ,  print "2 + 1 =", y
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,: 2 + 1 = 3
#+end_src

Notice that no problems are caused when code blocks of different
languages interact; this is because all values are passed through the
Emacs Lisp interpreter that is at the core of Emacs.  This argument
passing syntax allows for complex chaining of raw values in a
document, and of blocks of code in multiple languages as shown in
Section \ref{applications}.

** Export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: export
    :END:

Borrowing terms from the Literate Programming community Babel supports
both /weaving/ (the exportation of a mixed code/prose document to a
prose format suitable for reading by a human) and /tangling/ (the
exportation of a mixed code/prose document to a pure code file
suitable for execution by a computer).

- weaving :: Org-mode provides an extremely sophisticated and
     full-featured system of exportation to HTML, LaTeX, and a number
     of other target formats.  Babel adds support for the
     pre-processing of code blocks as part of the export process.
     This pre-processing allows for the code of a code block, the
     results of a code block, or both or neither to be included in the
     final exported document.

- tangling :: Tangling consists not only of extracting source code
     from an Org-mode document but also of re-arranging the code.
     Often the order in which a computer needs to be presented with
     code differs from the order in which the code may be best
     organized in a document.  LP systems like =noweb= solve this
     problem using code-block references which are expanded as part of
     the tangle process \cite{noweb}.  Babel implements the =noweb=
     reference system using the same syntax and functionality.

** Language support
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: languages
    :END:

The core functions of Babel are entirely language agnostic.  The
tangling, source edit and export features of Org-babel can be used
even for unsupported languages; only code evaluation and interaction
with live sessions require language-specific functions.  Support for
new languages can be added by defining a small number of
functions named according to language, following a couple of simple
conventions.  Currently Babel has support for more than 20 languages.  The
ease with which support for new languages can be added is evidenced by
the fact that increasingly new language support is increasingly
implemented by Org-babel users rather than by the original authors.

A number of features of Babel which make it a good choice as a tool
for the composition of combined natural and computational language
documents.

- Open source :: Babel is both /open source/ meaning it's inner
     working are publicly visible, and further, it's copyright is
     owned by the Free Software Foundation \cite{fsf}, meaning that
     Babel, and any work deriving from Babel will always be fully open
     to public scrutiny and modification.  This is *essential* for any
     tool supporting scientific peer review.

- Friendly active community :: the Org-mode community and be extension
     the community surrounding Babel is extremely friendly, which can
     be immeasurably helpful both for newcomers trying to get
     comfortable with the tool, and for developers looking for ideas
     and feedback.  Without this community the Babel project would
     never have reached a useable state.

- General :: A leading drive in the design of Babel was pursuit of
     generality.  Babel (through Org-mode) exports to many target file
     types (e.g. LaTeX, HTML, Beamer slideshows, ASCII, etc...), it
     supports arbitrary programming languages.  It displays no
     reproducible research or literate programming bias.

- Natural :: For Emacs users a transition to using Babel will allow
     them to continue using the same editor and major modes with which
     they are already familiar.

** Weaknesses and Future Work
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: future-work
   :END:
Babel certainly has a number of natural limits.  While Emacs provides
a number of extremely mature and full-featured environments for
authoring of code and text, and for controlling the evaluation of
text, it also brings with it a number of limiting factors.
- steep learning curve
  #+begin_comment
  Let's find a way of more nuanced way of saying that. I find that it
  gets exagerrated: Emacs has a menu with Open and Save, and when you
  hit "a" an "a" appears in the document, so in a sense how much more
  easy does it get?
  #+end_comment
- small community of users
- it's not the best execution VM or sublayer
  - single threaded
  - inefficient

These items indicate a number of paths for future work, either for
further development of Org-babel, or for any future tool of this type.

- editor agnostic :: One point where Babel is not as general as it
     could be is the range of available editing environments.  Despite
     the incredible amount of features that Emacs and Org-mode provide
     to Babel, they both also place limits on the pool of potential
     users to those who either already use Emacs and Org-mode, or are
     willing and able to adopt what can conservatively be described as
     a /sophisticated/ text editing environment.
     
     It seems that it would be possible for future tools of this
     nature to provide code evaluation and exportation as a service
     which could be called from any number of editors.  Such a
     structure would raise a number of challenging implementation
     issues.

- virtual machine :: Babel allows heterogeneous programming
     environments to share data by dropping all shared values to the
     common denominator of Emacs Lisp.  This works well for Babel as
     it allows for re-use of many pre-existing Emacs tools for
     evaluation of code in a variety of language, often making the
     addition of support for new languages trivial.

     There are however properties of Emacs Lisp which make it less
     than ideal as a medium of data exchange and as a shepherd of
     evaluation.  Most importantly the Emacs Lisp interpreter is
     /single threaded/, this makes the asynchronous evaluation of code
     blocks needlessly complex (in fact this features does not yet
     exist in Babel).
     
     Also, the execution of Emacs Lisp requires a running Emacs
     process.  There is no low-overhead method of evaluating Emacs
     Lisp in the absence of an Emacs session.  In the presence of such
     functionality it may be possible for Babel to support the
     tangling of multi-language /stand-alone executables/, further
     reducing the barrier to reproduction of works authored in Babel.
     
     Both of the above issues may be resolved naturally if Guile
     scheme replaces the existing Emacs Lisp execution engine, which
     at the time of writing seems a distinct possibility [fn::
     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-04/msg00665.html].

** Conclusion
As a single tool Babel satisfies the needs of both the reproducible
research and literate programming disciplines, it is in effect both a
/compendium/ and a /web/.

- compendium :: The formulation of a of compendium as put forth by
     Gentleman and Temple Lang requires of the following elements.
     1) Authoring Software
     2) Auxiliary Software
     3) Transformation Software
     4) Quality control Software
     5) Distribution Software

     The Babel environment used in combination with a traditional
     version control tool satisfies all of these requirements.  In
     addition, Babel handles three of the four points laid out in
     their proposed "Future Work", namely /multiple languages/,
     /conditional chunks/ (where "chunks" are blocks of text or code),
     and /interactivity/, meaning that the code can be executed from
     within the authoring environment.

- web :: Babel is a full featured /web/ tool.  It supports both
     /tangling/ and /weaving/ of code, as well as a sophisticated code
     block reference system along the lines of =noweb=.  Additionally
     the executability of code blocks in Babel allows for interactive
     development, and integration of test suites in a manner not
     supported in previous literate programming systems.

Through making it possible to adopt literate programming and
reproducible research practices while retaining a familiar editing
environment, Babel significantly lowers the barrier of entry.  Through
encouraging all stages of the research and development cycle to take
place within a single document Babel ensures that relevant code, data,
and text will be collocated, reducing the burden on the authors of
compiling such pieces of a large project after the fact.  Difficulty
of use/adoption has served as a major barrier to previous literate
programming and reproducible research systems, and we believe that
with its ease of adoption, along with the its universal applicability
across programming languages, Babel represents a significant,
qualitative advance in the design of literate programming and
reproducible research tools.

As such we believe Babel has the potential to significantly increase
the widespread acceptance of the expectation that code has
accompanying explanatory prose, and that any discussion of code or
computational results include both the discussed code and data..  It
is the authors hope that this work will ultimately help both software
developers and scientists to communicate and to make their work more
accessible.
