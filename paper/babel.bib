  abstract =     "SASweave is a collection of scripts that allow one to
                 embed SAS code into a {\LaTeX} document, and
                 automatically incorporate the results as well. SASweave
                 is patterned after Sweave, which does the same thing
                 for code written in R. In fact, a document may contain
                 both SAS and R code. Besides the convenience of being
                 able to easily incorporate SAS examples in a document,
                 SASweave facilitates the concept of ``literate
                 programming'': having code, documentation, and results
                 packaged together. Among other things, this helps to
                 ensure that the SAS output in the document is in
                 concordance with the code.",
