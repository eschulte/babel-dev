Manuscript:
o As a reminder, please make sure that:
  - \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout
the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.

o In all cases, code input/output must fit within the normal textwidth of
the manuscript. Thus, code input should have appropriate line breaks and
code output should preferably be generated with a suitable width (or
otherwise edited). As well as figures/tables/text/equations.
	o Page 2

o In itemized/bullet lists please capitalize the first word of the item. 
Please also add either a comma/semi-colon/period at the end of each
item.

o Figure placement (i.e. placement of floating objects): 
  The {figure} or {table} environment should be close to the first
  reference in the manuscript. It should first use the "t!" option for
  placement. If a figure then ends up before the start of its (sub)section,
  "t!" should be changed to "b!".  e.g., {figure}[b!].

o All captions should appear below the corresponding figure/table. The
captions should be in sentence style and end with a PERIOD.

o When using "e.g." and "i.e." add a comma after the period to keep LaTeX
from interpreting them as the end of a sentence, i.e.: "e.g., " and 
"i.e., ".
