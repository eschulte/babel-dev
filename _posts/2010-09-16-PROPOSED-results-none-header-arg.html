<p>I have some blocks which I'm executing in a remote session purely
for their side effects (defining functions in the session). Rather
than wait for the tramp machinery to transfer an empty results file
back to local, I'm wondering whether a new header arg :results none
might make sense.

This seems a near duplicate of the results <code>silent</code> header
argument.  Maybe <code>none</code> should just be an alias for <code>silent</code>.  Or
maybe <code>silent</code> should notice when it is used in remote execution
and in such cases not bother transferring back a result?
