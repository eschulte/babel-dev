<p>
The reason that <code>:results org</code> was introduced was to support
seamless insertion of results into an org-mode buffer.  This
proposal would defeat that initial purpose. [Eric]
</p>
<p>
No, we already have <code>:results raw</code> which is currently synonymous
with <code>org</code>. [Dan]
</p>
<p>
Also, the idea of org source blocks in an org-mode document seems
needlessly complex and contorted.  Of course I could be missing
something here. [Eric]
</p>
<p>
Org already supports org source blocks (e.g. line 50
org-src.el). And there's at least one clear use case for them,
i.e. demonstrating, in HTML, what an org buffer looks like:
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1.1">Test export </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.1">

<p>You're reading HTML at the moment, but this is what org looks like
in your emacs buffer.
</p>



<pre class="src src-org"><span style="color: #add8e6;">#+SEQ_TODO: x | o</span>
<span style="color: #7fffd4; font-weight: bold;">* x todo item</span>
  <span style="color: #ffa07a;">SCHEDULED:</span> <span style="color: #00ffff; text-decoration: underline;">&lt;2010-02-28 Sun&gt;</span>
</pre>



<p>
I admit that I don't know how often one will want to generate org
blocks using babel, but I think that to use <code>org</code> as a synonym of
<code>raw</code> is inconsistent with <code>:results latex</code>, <code>:results html</code>,
<code>:results code</code>. [Dan]
</p>
<p>
i.e. 
</p><pre class="example">
  #+begin_src org
    ,* whatever
  #+end_src
</pre>
