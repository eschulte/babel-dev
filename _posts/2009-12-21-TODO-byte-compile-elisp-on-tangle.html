<pre class="example">1) When the org configuration file aren't changed, a way to automatically load
their tangled version (bytecompiled ?) in order to improve the initialization
time of Emacs.
</pre>



<ul>
<li>
are there times when this wouldn't be desirable?
</li>
<li>
maybe this should be controlled by <b>another</b> header argument

</li>
</ul>

<p>also we need to address some <code>:tangle</code> header argument related bugs in
`org-babel-load-file'
</p>



<pre class="example">2) If I include a source code block without a :tangle argument, then the .el file is truncated in odd
ways.  For instance, if the last source code block doesn't have a tangle argument but all the source code
blocks above it have either :tangle yes or :tangle no, then the .el file only contains the tangled source
code block without the tangle argument.

I've had other permutations of 2)
 where only source code blocks after a :tangle no source code block get tangled.

If all of the source code blocks have :tangle arguments, then all seems to be well.
