<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="done DEFERRED"> DEFERRED</span> org-babel-tangle should check if in org-mode </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "DEFERRED"   from "TODO" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-05-26 Wed 06:56</span></span>
</li>
<li>
State "TODO"       from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-04-17 Sat 19:12</span></span>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Why?  I just successfully tangled from within my scratch buffer
without any problems.  If no org-mode functions are explicitly
required, then why not let people tangle from wherever they like?
