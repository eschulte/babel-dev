title: REJECTED :results org should be org block
layout: default
---



<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="done REJECTED"> REJECTED</span> :results org should be org block </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "REJECTED"   from "PROPOSED" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2009-12-22 Tue 14:40</span></span>

</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason that <code>:results org</code> was introduced was to support
seamless insertion of results into an org-mode buffer.  This
proposal would defeat that initial purpose.  Also, the idea of org
source blocks in an org-mode document seems needlessly complex and
contorted.  Of course I could be missing something here.

i.e. 
</p><pre class="example">
  #+begin_src org
    ,* whatever
  #+end_src
</pre>
