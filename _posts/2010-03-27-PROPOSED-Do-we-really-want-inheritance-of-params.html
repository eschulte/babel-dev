<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="todo PROPOSED"> PROPOSED</span> Do we really want inheritance of params? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "PROPOSED"   from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-03-27 Sat 16:56</span></span>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The following example suggest that inheritance of params by the
referenced block may be undesirable. What do we actually need it for?
</p>



<div class="org-src-container"><label class="org-src-name">four()</label><pre class="src src-ruby">
4
</pre></div>





<pre class="src src-ruby">print x
</pre>



</div>
</div>
