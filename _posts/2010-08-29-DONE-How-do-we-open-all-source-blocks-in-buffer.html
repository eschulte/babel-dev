<p>
This is an org-mode issue, but relevant to us. org visibility
cycling just opens headings. An example of when you might want
absolutely everything to be open is when using C-s to search
through a buffer.
</p>
<p>
So, currently even closed source blocks will open temporarily for
searching because of the way they are hidden.  Also there is the
`org-show-block-all'
</p>


<pre class="example">org-show-block-all is a Lisp function in `org.el'.

(org-show-block-all)

Unfold all blocks in the current buffer.
</pre>


<p>
function which will reveal all blocks in the current buffer, I
guess the question then becomes &ndash; should this be bound to a key,
or should it somehow hook into the org visibility cycling.
</p>
<p>
And should it be made interactive? If so let's raise it on
list. Personally I can deal with it not being part of visibility
cycling, so I think this item may be almost DONE.
</p>
<p>
OK, you made it interactive (c4d385681f6c70), so I'm closing this
item.
