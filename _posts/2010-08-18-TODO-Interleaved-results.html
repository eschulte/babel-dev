<p>See <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/28989">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/28989</a> a summary of
which follows.
</p>
<p>
Interleaved input and output can be achieved easily in R :results
output (no session) using the method below. So it might be nice to
offer :results output echo, where "echo" means include the input
commands. This requires:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
implementation for :session

</li>
</ul>

<p>(in principle sounds not hard, as it involves <b>not</b> doing something
(i.e. not removing commands from comint output)).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
implementation for other external interpreter processes

</li>
</ul>

<p>For bash, it's somewhat similar to 'bash -x'. I looked at man python
and didn't see anything; perhaps it is accomplished by modifying the
output stream when python is running rather than as a command line
option to the interpreter. ruby? etc.

R :results output external interpreter process implementation:

(setq org-babel-R-command "R &ndash;silent &ndash;no-save")
