<dt>[ ] org-babel-LANG-evaluate variable name</dt><dd>
In some languages the
argument list includes BUFFER but we then refer to SESSION in the
function.

<dt>[ ] split org-babel-LANG-evaluate into session and non-session</dt><dd>

Like clojure does.

<dt>[ ] tangle to buffers and write to file at end</dt><dd>
Now that we don't
use append-to-file (see
73d8e5768570d62e79f19b117b599f668b6abc17), it would be more
efficient to append the tangled output to buffers, and ultimately
write the buffers to file and kill the buffers. I didn't
implement that, as it required a fair bit of kessing about with
org-babel-tangle, but if someone has time it would be nice. The
efficiency gain will presumably be considerable for remote tangle
files.

<dt>[ ] Internals - Code sharing with org-babel-execute-buffer</dt><dd>

<p>
Functions like org-babel-pop-to-session have to go through some
initial variable binding which partially overlaps with the
variable bindings in org-babel-execute-src-block. If possible, it
would be nice to abstract the common set-up into shared code. For
example, I recently added default-directory in the let-binding of
o-b-execute-src-block, and subsequently realised that it also
needed to be added to o-b-pop-to-session.
