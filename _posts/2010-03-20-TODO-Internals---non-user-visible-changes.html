refer to SESSION in the function.

Now that we don't use append-to-file (see
73d8e5768570d62e79f19b117b599f668b6abc17), it would be more
efficient to append the tangled output to buffers, and
ultimately write the buffers to file and kill the buffers. I
didn't implement that, as it required a fair bit of kessing
about with org-babel-tangle, but if someone has time it would be
nice. The efficiency gain will presumably be considerable for
remote tangle files.

<p>
Functions like org-babel-pop-to-session have to go through some
initial variable binding which partially overlaps with the
variable bindings in org-babel-execute-src-block. If possible, it
would be nice to abstract the common set-up into shared code. For
example, I recently added default-directory in the let-binding of
o-b-execute-src-block, and subsequently realised that it also
needed to be added to o-b-pop-to-session.
