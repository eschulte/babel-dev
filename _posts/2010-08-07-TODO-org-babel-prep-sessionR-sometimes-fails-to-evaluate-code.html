<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="todo TODO"> TODO</span> org-babel-prep-session:R sometimes fails to evaluate code </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>

State "TODO"       from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-08-07 Sat 18:01</span></span>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Sometimes the R-prep-session function fails to evaluate the code,
because there is some text lying around at the prompt in the session
buffer. Is there a way of guarenteeing that the session is ready to
accept input?
