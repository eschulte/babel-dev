<p>
For boolean header args like cache, noweb and colnames, the value
is &lt;on&gt; if the header arg is yes; absent or any other value is
&lt;off&gt;.
</p>
<p>
Is it worth considering nil or absent = &lt;off&gt;, and any non-absent
value = &lt;on&gt;, in order to be in line with lisp?
</p>
<p>
I think this would also make sense from the point of view of
least-surprise, because the default sense of those args is &lt;off&gt;;
and anyone who is supplying them is likely to be wanting to turn
them &lt;on&gt;, and so the only way for them to fail to do what they
want would be if they supplied nil.
</p>
<p>
In particular, users might be surprised that t, y, Y, on, Yes
don't work.
</p>
<p>
I guess we're going to have to really want to make this change to
accept the backwards incompatibility cost, but I'm just noting it
down. It could always be implemented by a variable.
