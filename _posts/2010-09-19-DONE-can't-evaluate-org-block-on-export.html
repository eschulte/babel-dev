title: DONE can't evaluate org block on export

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="done DONE"> DONE</span> can't evaluate org block on export </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "DONE"       from "TODO" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-09-19 Sun 10:52</span></span>
</li>
<li>
State "TODO"       from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-09-17 Fri 10:12</span></span>

</li>
</ul>

<p>This involves nested calls to the org exporter which breaks because
the temporary buffer name <code>org-mode-tmp</code> is hard-coded in
`org-export-preprocess-string'.
</p>
<p>
For now the solution here is to <b>not</b> set the <code>:results</code> header
argument of the org code block, which will result in the code block
safely evaluating without requiring an Org-mode export, then the
content of the code block will export successfully with the rest of
the org-mode file.
