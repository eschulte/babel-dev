<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="done DONE"> DONE</span> Org-babel should work well when indented </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "DONE"       from "TODO" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-06-10 Thu 15:48</span></span>
</li>
<li>
State "TODO"       from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-06-10 Thu 10:13</span></span>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
This should be fairly straightforward.

<p>
This actually turned into a fairly comprehensive reworking of info
variable in Org-babel.  It now carries indentation information, and
most all org-babel functionality should now work when indented.
