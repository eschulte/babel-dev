<p>Working on the documentation of :cache it occurred to me that I
rarely change source code, but frequently update tables passed in
to the source block as variables.  Since it now takes several
minutes to export my adze web site, it would be nice to have a hash
of the table variables cached as well and the code re-run only if
one of more of the tables referenced by the variables had changed.
