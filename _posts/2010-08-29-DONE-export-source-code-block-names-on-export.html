<p>We do this now. There is currently a pending patch by david
O'Toole which concerns this. See <a href="#id:0ee521bb-b2db-4f59-8c75-b01085b2653a">Review David O'Toole export patch</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
perhaps using an org-mode macro
</li>
<li>
noweb has a syntax for doing this on latex export
</li>
<li>
maybe even include a list of where it is used&hellip;

</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good idea.  It would be nice to make the
&gt;&gt;&gt; appearance
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the exported names customizable as I can see many different
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibilities and would prefer to leave the actual choice up to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; user.  Would macros allow for over-definition/customization by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; user?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am afraid you have to ask the Org mode developers this question.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; understood :) I'll look into this


I don't know whether you can call Emacs Lisp functions in an Org
macro, but perhaps you can talk the Org developers into allowing for
that. Emacs Lisp functions can be over written.. Even better, you
could then define a hook, and have a clean extendable solution.
