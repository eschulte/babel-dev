<p>
this is from suggestions coming through the mailing list
</p><blockquote>

<pre class="example">
    Do you think this is the sort of thing that would need to be
    customized on a per-block or per-file/subtree basis?

Yes, I think it would be useful. An example would be if I want to create two scripts, where one is
running on my local computer, and the other on a cluster, in which the paths might be different.
Also: there is, in addition to R, also Ra, with Just-In-Time compiling functionality. It might be
useful to be able to have two R scripts, one using R, the other Ra, for e.g. profiling. Another
example would be to try different versions of e.g. R.

So yes, I think it would be very useful to define the two additional header arguments for each
block:

:shebang NIL for default, other string for the shebang line
:headers NIL for default, NONE for no headers, other string for custom headers
 

    If so we may want to move this customization behind a header argument.

That would be great

<p>
I think the best names for these new header-arguments would be
<code>:shebang</code> (which could be multiple lines long if stored in an elisp
variable) and (to me at least) <code>:comments</code> is more intuitive than
<code>:headers</code> to control the insertion of org-babel comments with links
back to the original tangling document.
</p>
<p>
This is now implemented using the <code>:shebang</code> and <code>:comments</code> header
arguments, so for example the following block will tangle with <b>no</b>
comments
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
  (message "I should have no comments")
#+end_src
</pre>


<p>
and the following will tangle using a custom shebang line
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+begin_src ruby :shebang #!/usr/bin/ruby
  puts :nonstandard_shebang
#+end_src
</pre>
