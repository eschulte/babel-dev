<p>First of all, I would think we have a separate chapter about
Org Babel.  My feeling is that this chapter should be no longer than
10, maybe 15 pages to make it not dominate the manual.  I am not quite
sure what we can put into this envelope.  It definitely should be
enough to explain the basics, and one or two simple examples.  This
will not replace the extensive tutorials etc on the web,
but my hope would be that all essential information from  but maybe
the information <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/</a>
reference.php can be captured in there.
</p>
<p>
I have actually been thinking to switch from @example to @smallexample
(and similar) for the entire manual - this would save quite some
space, I believe.  But I still need to make test prints to see if this
is a viable option.
</p>
<p>
Then we will mention Org babel stuff where-ever necessary - obviously
in the section about literal examples, and in the export chapter.  I
don't see right now where else - yes, in the Introduction of course,
with one sentence.

<p>
I just created a <code>babel-doc</code> branch up in the babel forked repository
on repo.or.cz which can hold this work.  Hopefully it will largely be
a straightforward process of converting reference.org from Worg into a
texinfo and manual style document, and then similarly transferring
over a couple of examples.
