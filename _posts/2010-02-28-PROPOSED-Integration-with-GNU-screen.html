<p>It might be nice to support some relationship between babel
sessions and screen sessions, so that babel sessions have
persistency (particularly useful for remote sessions).

This will be most straightforward for shell sessions. But the
fact that ess-remote "converts" an emacs shell session running R
into an inferior ESS comint R session suggests that it may be
possible for R also.
