<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="todo PROPOSED"> PROPOSED</span> do we want to make the naming of code block optional? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "PROPOSED"   from "TODO" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-06-08 Tue 16:38</span></span>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Do we always want every named code block to export with a name?
</p>
<p>
It seems like this could be a useful place for a customization
variable.
</p>
<p>
note that the actual exportation is handled in org-exp.el (see
<a href="file:///home/dan/src/org/lisp/org-exp.el">~/src/org/lisp/org-exp.el::format n s equiv n caption</a>)
