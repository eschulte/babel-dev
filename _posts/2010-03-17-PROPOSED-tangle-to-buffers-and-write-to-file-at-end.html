Now that we don't use append-to-file (see
73d8e5768570d62e79f19b117b599f668b6abc17), it would be more
efficient to append the tangled output to buffers, and
ultimately write the buffers to file and kill the buffers. I
didn't implement that, as it required a fair bit of kessing
about with org-babel-tangle, but if someone has time it would be
nice. The efficiency gain will presumably be considerable for
remote tangle files.
