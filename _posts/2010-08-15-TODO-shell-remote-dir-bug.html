<p>
This seems to be a bug in tramp. If the target directory is specified
with a relative path (as in ':bennch' below) then while it is fine on
the first evaluation, subsequent evaluations seem to "remember" the
location of the default directory. So they are already in it when they
try to cd into it again. Thus there is an error because ~/bench exists
while ~/bench/bench does not.
