<p>Reasons for integrating tangling with org mode's existing export
functionality
</p><ul>
<li>
tangling is a kind of export, to source code
</li>
<li>
ensures the original buffer remains unchanged through the temporary
export buffer
</li>
<li>
makes expansion through tangling clear through setting the temporary
export-target variable to <code>tangle</code>
</li>
<li>
would automatically expand <code>#+INCLUDE:</code> lines
</li>
</ul>
