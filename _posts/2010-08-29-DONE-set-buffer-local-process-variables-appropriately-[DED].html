<p>When switching to a edit buffer for R, if :session is active then
we should set ess-current-process-name (or is it
ess-local-process-name?) to the session name. Implementation?
Presumably this uses org-src-mode-hook somehow.

<p>I think something like this would be great. You've probably
already thought of this, but just to note it down: it would be really
nice if org-babel's notion of a buffer's 'session/process' played
nicely with ESS's notion of the buffer's session/process. ESS keeps
the current process name for a buffer in a buffer-local variable
ess-current-process-name (or is it ess-local-process-name?). So one
thing we will probably want to do is make sure that the <b>Org Edit Src Example</b> buffer sets that variable appropriately. [DED]

I had not thought of that, but I agree whole heartedly. [Eric]

<p>
Once this is done every variable should be able to dump regions into
their inferior-process buffer using major-mode functions.
