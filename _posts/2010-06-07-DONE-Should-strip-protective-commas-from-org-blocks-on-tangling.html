<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="done DONE"> DONE</span> Should strip protective commas from org blocks on tangling </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "DONE"       from "TODO" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-06-07 Mon 11:43</span></span>
</li>
<li>
State "TODO"       from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-04-15 Thu 13:14</span></span>

</li>
</ul>

<p>This has been fixed with a simple call to `replace-regexp-in-string',
one may thing that there would be a complex function for removing the
commas, but org-mode uses a simple regexp as well &ndash; so apparently
this approach is safe.
