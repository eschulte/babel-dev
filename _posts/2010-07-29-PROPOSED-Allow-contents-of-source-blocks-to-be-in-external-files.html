&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to revisit the discussion that we had before about the
&gt; possibility of having src blocks in which the code is not actually
&gt; embedded in an org file.
&gt;
&gt; This is the only major obstacle I've encountered in using babel: what
&gt; started off as a project with tangled babel src blocks ended up as a
&gt; traditional non-babel project: the babel part died completely.
</p>
<p>
I've had similar issues, and see some more on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
&gt; The reason was that some of the collaborators were non babel users,
&gt; and we needed a way for changes to the code to be propagated in all
&gt; directions among the authors. We were using git, and a related point
&gt; is that I am attracted to tracking code changes and org text changes
&gt; separately in my VCS (e.g. as would be done automatically if they
&gt; resided in separate files)
&gt;
&gt; The thread from the list discussion we had is 
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/24431">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/24431</a>
&gt;
&gt; Do you have any updated thoughts on this topic? Is it relevant to babel?
</p>
<p>
I think that a general "remote block" solution would be best, maybe even
a solution which allows remote tables (would include radio tables).
</p>
<p>
&gt; 
&gt; Should we be thinking in terms of org blocks or org links or both or
&gt; neither??
&gt;
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure what the best implementation system would be.  I'd check
what the radio table implementation uses.  Currently there is some
minimal support for relating source code sections to org-mode documents
through comments, however special comment insertion may not always be
possible (thinking legacy code, or large projects).  So ideally the
solution should require <b>no</b> org-specific markup in the source files.
</p>
<p>
Definitely a challenging problem &ndash; I wonder if there is existing
similar Emacs support for maintaining remote references to sections of
files (e.g. TAGS).
</p>
<p>
Best &ndash; Eric
