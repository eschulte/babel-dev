<pre class="example">&lt;spcshpopr8r&gt; hallo emacsers
&lt;spcshpopr8r&gt; I have successfully, finally, got on board with org-babel and
             ess...earlier today, my head exploded  [15:39]
*** JayM (~jay@cpe-76-186-94-148.tx.res.rr.com) has quit: Ping timeout: 268
    seconds
*** CrustY (~klon@91.187.21.231) has quit: Read error: Connection reset by
    peer
&lt;spcshpopr8r&gt; now I want to execute an arbitary bunch of sql against an oracle
             database and then feed the results to an R block
*** CrustY (~klon@91.187.21.231) has joined channel #emacs  [15:40]
&lt;jave&gt; btw org vs planner?
*** gnuvince (~vince@72.0.219.6) has quit: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
*** kenshin (~kenshin@59.95.54.181) has quit: Quit: Ex-Chat
&lt;spcshpopr8r&gt; I've looked a little bit at org-babel-sql.el and it seems pretty
             spartan...like it just wants to talk to a mysql database at the
             moment  [15:41]
*** gnuvince (~vince@72.0.219.6) has joined channel #emacs
*** Colloguy (~flx@64.134.18.188) has joined channel #emacs
&lt;spcshpopr8r&gt; anybody here got a simple solution to get org-babel
             (org-babel-sql that is) to talk to my li'l ol oracle databases?

<p>
Ideally there's a single sql-mode for emacs that we can interact
with&hellip;  it looks like <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SqlMode">sql-mode</a> is the way to go.  I'd say we add that
as a requirement to org-babel-sql, and then start building up the
integration with&hellip;
</p>
<ol>
<li>
start using sql-mode builtins for connection &ndash; which should extend
us to other database engines
</li>
<li>
add more header arguments (<code>passwrd</code>, <code>database</code>, <code>username</code>, etc&hellip;)
</li>
<li>
support persistent sessions
</li>
<li>
support returning query results as lists/tables
</li>
<li>
support dropping lists/tables into insert statements
</li>
</ol>
