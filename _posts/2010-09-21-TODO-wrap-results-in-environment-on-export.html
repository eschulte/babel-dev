&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you mind creating an LaTeX environment around the =results= block, so
&gt;&gt;&gt; that we could have the code colorized (via listings or Minted), and clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt; distinguish the results, if we want so.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Having an environment would allow one to use non-proportional font for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; results, or a shadowed background, or...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Would such an environment be in addition too or in place of wrapping results
&gt;&gt; in the example environment?
&gt;
&gt; I would think of something like this:
&gt;
&gt; \begin{orgresults}
&gt; &lt;... results block ...&gt;
&gt; \end{orgresults}
&gt;
&gt; so that one can customize the =orgresults= environment in LaTeX to get a
&gt; colored background, another font, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; What would you suggest for tabular results?
&gt;
&gt; Nothing different for tables: just the same plain default environment around
&gt; the results part.
