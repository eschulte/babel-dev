<p>If I understood correctly you always save the output to a file using the
function org-babel-octave-wrapper-method, right? Maybe instead of using
"%s save -ascii %s ans"
to save the information to a file you can use
"%s save -text %s ans"
I tested this for numbers, strings and matrices and it seems to do the
right thing. However, octaves adds some comment lines in the beginning of
the file that you will probably need to remove, but you just need to remove
lines that start with "#".
</p>
<p>
Regarding which value is returned, maybe you can use the same approach
employed for python, where a line "return variable" is required in the end
of the block, instead of just returning the value of ans.
</p>
<p>
In fact, I don't like to put a return statement in the end of the block
just to make babel happy (python included), since I don't want this when I
tangle the file, but this is the most flexible way.
</p>
<p>
Maybe a good feature request for babel it that instead "exports: value" one
has to write "exports: value variable" and this would have the effect of
the "return variable" in the end of the block that we have right now for
python.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the graphical output, It is probably better to use :results file
as suggested in the TODO. There may be necessary a lot of details in the
graphic output such as labels, setting axis, etc.. It is better to let the
user handle this in the code and just put the link to the file.
