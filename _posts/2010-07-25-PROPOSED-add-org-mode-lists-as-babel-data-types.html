&gt; 3) Since I can't help but relate things to Babel&hellip; What do you think<br/>
&gt;    about having list types recognized by Babel (as arrays).  This could<br/>
&gt;    add nice flexibility to passing data back and forth between Babel and<br/>
&gt;    the buffer, it could make it possible to do some fancy list stuff,<br/>
&gt;    and if we add Hash-Maps or Dictionaries to Babel as first class<br/>
&gt;    objects (which seems like a reasonable move at some point in the<br/>
&gt;    nearish future) then they could integrate well with description<br/>
&gt;    lists.<br/>
<br/>
It's a good idea, and I think the job from org-list side is already<br/>
done, thanks to Bastien Guerry. You should have a look at<br/>
`org-list-parse-list' and `org-list-to-generic'. With both of them,<br/>
you can change a list back and forth to anything you'd like.<br/>
