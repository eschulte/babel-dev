<p>Belatedly documenting this issue from the mailing list.

<p>
The main idea being that it would be nice to allow large chunks of an
org-mode file to be exported as comments to tangled source code files.
That way all the excellent documentation is not lost.  The main
questions seem to be about the best implementation.  The entire thread
is available on gmane at <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/25779">gmane.emacs.orgmode/25779</a>.

Yes, your idea about prefixing every line in the org file behind a<br/>
comment except for the tangled code was the initial idea in my head.<br/>
I then thought that there may be several different languages of code<br/>
in an org-mode file, and even if there is only one language, the<br/>
tangling of that file could be generating multiple source files, for<br/>
example, one per function.  In addition, some of the org-mode material<br/>
I have in my file might not relate to a commented source file, per se.<br/>
For example, the org-mode file where I maintain my source for a<br/>
function might have links to emails discussing the implementation, or<br/>
internal dialogs relating to alternative approaches that were<br/>
abandoned.<br/>

So, I thought it might be neat to have some way of specifying which<br/>
subtrees would be a part of the comments for a source file, and for<br/>
which tangled file.  My guess as the easiest way to do that would be<br/>
through properties.  That is, you'd set a property for (sub)tree like,<br/>
for example:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These (sub)trees would then appear as comments in their respective<br/>
tangled source files in whatever order they appear in the org-mode<br/>
file.<br/>
<br/>
Why am I suggesting this?<br/>
<br/>
People obviously like commented code.  Writing a function in<br/>
org-babel, I am in effect using org-mode as the commenting system.<br/>
Giving someone who does not use Emacs an org-mode file to see how<br/>
something was implemented is not going to fly, to say the least :).<br/>
Giving them the tangled version of the code along with, say, an HTML<br/>
export of the org-mode buffer is a good start.  But if they're used to<br/>
reviewing code in the typical, "just send me the source file" manner,<br/>
they would appreciate comments in the code. This is one way they could<br/>
be automatically generated from org-mode/org-babel, which is, in my<br/>
mind, the ideal.<br/>
<br/>
As I'm sure you have plenty to do, I would be happy to take a look at<br/>
this.  I'll give the requisite "I'm just getting started with elisp<br/>
&hellip;" warning though. :)<br/>

I would pass the function an org-mode link then write out the contents<br/>
pointed at by the link inside a named code block, with each line<br/>
preceded by an optional comment character.  If this were written in a<br/>
general way, then it would be possible to include comments from any<br/>
link&ndash;on-line manuals, standards, blogs, etc.&ndash;in addition to notes in<br/>
the org-mode file.<br/>
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p><br/>
If it were written in a very general way, with a transformation<br/>
function responsible for adding the comment character, then a variety<br/>
of transformations might be possible.<br/>
