<p>How to make it possible to use org-babel interactively from within an
interactive terminal (read: notebook, REPL, shell, or comint buffer --
whatever name makes sense to you), rather than in it's current context
of an Org-mode file.
</p>
<p>
This would require a number of new features&hellip;
</p><ol>
<li>
a nice interface
<ul>
<li>
embedded images, and videos, or arbitrary x-windows (e.g. a
screen make by gnuplot), maybe a generic 
</li>
<li>
allow input of multi-line code segments &ndash; maybe related to
language selection&hellip;
</li>
<li>
allow for switching the <i>current language</i>
</li>
<li>
possibly allow function definitions
</li>
<li>
possibly support some form of export (maybe should export to an
org-mode buffer which would then export arbitrarily)

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
a way to maintain a persistent environment, s.t. variables and
functions can maintain a persistent value over the course of a
session

</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
sage for example provides a base library of operations, which can
be called outside of the use of any particular package.  In the
same way we should provide for calling basic operations directly
without having to open up a code block, examples could be a generic
means of graphing objects, simple arithmetic and matrix operations,
file I/O, etc&hellip;

</li>
</ol>

<p>we should be able to use the existing lob and named code block
functionality to define all of these primitives &ndash; probably using
elisp as the preferred language for these code blocks.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
undoubtedly there is more&hellip;

</li>
</ol>

<p>Another popular notebook system is <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">sage</a>, maybe some inspiration can be
drawn from there.
</p>
<p>
It could be nice to wrap up calc functions so that they can easily be
called from this command line.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully there's a rational way to extend the existing Org-babel
functionality into this sort of an interface without either adding too
many ad-hoc features or writing too much code.

<h3 id="sec-1_1">interface &ndash; Org-mode comint buffer </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_1">

<p>just to <i>stream-of-consciouses</i> for a moment.
</p>
<p>
how will this comint buffer look, and should it even be a comint
buffer?
</p>
<p>
Increasingly since Org-babel is fully capable of handing back org-mode
formatted text from any execution, I'm thinking that the interactive
notebook should have Org-mode as it's major mode.
</p>
<p>
Then each execution (every time the user presses enter to send a line
of code to the interpreter) could generate a new headline, and both
the results and the related code could be placed under this headline.
</p>
<p>
In this way a series of executions at the "prompt" would result in a
series of folded headlines above the prompt, with the latest headline
always unfolded and immediately below the prompt.  I think this could
turn out to be a fairly natural interface.
