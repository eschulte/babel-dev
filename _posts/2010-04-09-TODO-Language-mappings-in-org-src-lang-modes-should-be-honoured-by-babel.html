<p>&gt; And it doesn't export any source even if it looks something like this
&gt;
&gt; * Org mode
&gt; ** Clock configuration
&gt; #+begin<sub>src</sub> elisp :tangle yes
&gt; ;; Clock configuration
&gt; (setq org-clock-persist t)
&gt; (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
&gt; #+end<sub>src</sub>

Although Org maps "elisp" to emacs-lisp-mode in org-src-lang-modes
(therefore C-c ' works), Org-babel currently does not recognise "elisp"
by default. Thanks for raising this, I think we need to make ourselves
more compatible with org-src-lang-modes.
</p>
<p>
So the short answer is: change "elisp" to "emacs-lisp".
</p>
<p>
The longer answer is, you could do
</p>
<p>
(org-babel-add-interpreter "elisp")
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-langs '("elisp" "el"))
</p>
<p>
But you (we) 'll still be faced with the problem that org-babel-load-file
expects the blocks to be "emacs-lisp" blocks. org-babel-tangle-file, on
the other hand, will work.
