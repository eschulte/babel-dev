&gt; OTOH this may not make it easier to debug, the babel error window<br/>
&gt; doesn't list line numbers or blocks where the error occurred. Perhaps<br/>
&gt; that should be a feature request to log what src block or org file<br/>
&gt; line number the errors occurred in.<br/>

This could be very useful both when evaluating an entire block or
subtree, and also when old error messages have built up in the Error
buffer.
