<p>In the spirit of <code>org-agenda-file-to-front</code> add a new function for
adding lob files, <code>org-babel-lob-add</code>.  This should work similarly to
the agenda-files function, and should not require any hand written
customization files.
</p>
<p>
This will probably come in the form of org-babel-lob-add and
org-babel-lob-remove functions, and a new org-babel-lob-files
variable.
</p>
<p>
Now I just need to figure out how to load up these files when Org-mode
is first initialized.  The simplest solution may be to ask the user to
place a call to org-babel-lob-initialize or somesuch in their .emacs
file.

Thanks to Aidan Gauland and Jambunathan K. for the suggestion
