<p>In the spirit of <code>org-agenda-file-to-front</code> add a new function for
adding lob files, <code>org-babel-lob-add</code>.  This should work similarly to
the agenda-files function, and should not require any hand written
customization files.
</p>
<p>
This will probably come in the form of org-babel-lob-add and
org-babel-lob-remove functions, and a new org-babel-lob-files
variable.
</p>
<p>
Now I just need to figure out how to load up these files when Org-mode
is first initialized.  The simplest solution may be to ask the user to
place a call to org-babel-lob-initialize or somesuch in their .emacs
file.

That 'sounds' like a new #+STARTUP directive to me ...


,----[ C-h v org-startup-options RET ]
| org-startup-options is a variable defined in `org.el'.

| Documentation:
| Variable associated with STARTUP options for org-mode.
| Each element is a list of three items: The startup options as written
| in the #+STARTUP line, the corresponding variable, and the value to
| set this variable to if the option is found.  An optional forth element PUSH
| means to push this value onto the list in the variable.
