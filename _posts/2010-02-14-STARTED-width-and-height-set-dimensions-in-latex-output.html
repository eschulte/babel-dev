Should we be setting ATTR<sub>LaTeX</sub> in this situation?
</p>
<p>
So it looks like we somehow need to pass the width through to R as
a variable.  Are the current variable passing methods insufficient
for this task?  Or would it just be more convenient if the R
execution code automatically checked for a value of ATTR<sub>LaTeX</sub> and
setup the R environment to correspond.  I don't really know R that
well, so I'm not sure how this would work, but it does seem like
it'd be handy if/once it was implemented. [Eric]
