This should now be possible as beamer support has been added to
Org mode. It might be nice to have other presentation
formats. I'm marking this as done as the babel part should
already be working via existing export mechanisms

The <a href="#mairix:t:@@9854.1246500519@gamaville.dokosmarshall.org">recent thread</a> containing posts by Nick Dokos and Sebastian
Vaub√°n on exporting to beamer looked very interesting, but I
haven't had time to try it out yet. I would really like it if,
eventually, we can generate a presentation (with graphics generated
by code blocks) from the same org file that contains all the notes
and code etc. I just wanted that to be on record in this document;
I don't have anything more profound to say about it at the moment,
and I'm not sure to what extent it is an org-babel issue.
