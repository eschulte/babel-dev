I like the idea of displaying the <code>begin/end src</code> lines as commented
sections in the org-edit-special code buffer, and then potentially
using them to change the values of the <code>begin/end src</code> lines in the
original Org-mode buffer after exiting the src-edit buffer.  It would
be very cool to be able to edit header arguments while editing source
code.

It may be hard to implement, but could be worth the effort.
