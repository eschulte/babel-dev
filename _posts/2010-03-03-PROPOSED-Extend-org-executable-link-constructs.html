I just noticed the following link types in the <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/External-links.html#External-links">org manual</a>

</li>
</ul>




<pre class="example">shell:ls *.org                            A shell command
elisp:org-agenda                          Interactive Elisp command
elisp:(find-file-other-frame "Elisp.org") Elisp form to evaluate
</pre>



<p>
The above can be placed within the standard construct:
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[link][description]]
</pre>


<p>
I wonder whether we had that sufficiently in mind when we designed
our in-line blocks? Some possibilities that come to mind are:
</p>
<p>
The above suggests that babel could extend org by supporting
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[ruby: 2+2]] and [[ruby: 2+2][description]]
</pre>


<p>
etc.
</p>
<p>
And perhaps header args in {} rather than []
</p>
<pre class="example">
[[ruby{:session}]] and [[ruby{:session}: 2+2][description]]
</pre>


<p>
If we needed to differentiate the babel handler from the org handler
then we could use
</p><pre class="example">
[[src_ruby: 2+2]]
</pre>

<p>although I think I would like to keep the syntax identical, using
variables to decide who handles what, so that it is invisible to the
user.
