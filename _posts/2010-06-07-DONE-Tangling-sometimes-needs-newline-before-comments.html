title: DONE Tangling sometimes needs newline before comments

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="done DONE"> DONE</span> Tangling sometimes needs newline before comments </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "DONE"       from "PROPOSED" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-06-07 Mon 12:26</span></span>
</li>
<li>
State "PROPOSED" from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-04-03 Sat 11:53</span></span>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If code block starts with comment it can get appended to end of
previous block without intervening newline. (This happened with
uncommentable t).
</p>
<p>
this should already be fixed by recent changes to
org-babel-tangle.el
</p></div>
</div>
