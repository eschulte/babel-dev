Although Org maps "elisp" to emacs-lisp-mode in org-src-lang-modes<br/>
(therefore C-c ' works), Org-babel currently does not recognise "elisp"<br/>
by default. Thanks for raising this, I think we need to make ourselves<br/>
more compatible with org-src-lang-modes.<br/>
<br/>
So the short answer is: change "elisp" to "emacs-lisp".<br/>
<br/>
The longer answer is, you could do<br/>
<br/>
(org-babel-add-interpreter "elisp")<br/>
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-langs '("elisp" "el"))<br/>
<br/>
But you (we) 'll still be faced with the problem that org-babel-load-file<br/>
expects the blocks to be "emacs-lisp" blocks. org-babel-tangle-file, on<br/>
the other hand, will work.<br/>
