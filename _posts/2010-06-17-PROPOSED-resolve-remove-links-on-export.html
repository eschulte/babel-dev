<p>Thanks to Austin Frank for brining this up
</p>
<p>
this may be an org-mode issue
</p>
<p class="verse">
&gt; Is "scpc" in the line above a transport protocol?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is scp over an existing ssh connection.  The following org-style<br/>
link goes to the relevant info page.<br/>
<br/>
<i>&lt;info:tramp:External methods&gt;</i><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe this should be an org-mode wide features, i.e. the ability to<br/>
&gt; resolve remote file references with C-c C-o and on export.  Does that<br/>
&gt; sound reasonable, and would it take care of the need in this<br/>
&gt; particular case?<br/>
<br/>
C-c C-o actually works!  I was extremely encouraged to see this, and it<br/>
got my hopes up for export =)<br/>
<br/>
If remote file references could be resolved during export, that would be<br/>
ideal.<br/>
