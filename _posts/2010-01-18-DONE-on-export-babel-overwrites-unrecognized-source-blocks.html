Thanks to SÃ©bastien for this bug report.

<blockquote>

<p>You see that when the language is unknown to Org-babel (<code>Delphi</code> in
this example), it gets ignored during export, and gets replaced by
the previous code block!!
</p>
<p>
So, the current workaround is to take whatever other language know
to Babel (here: <code>perl</code>) for the export to (at least) output the
right code in the generated document (even if not correctly
highlighted).

demonstrated in the attached <a href="data/babel-overwrite.html">babel-overwrite.org</a>
</p>
<p>
Probably has something to do with the conflicting regular expressions
between org-babel-exp.el and org-exp-blocks.el&hellip;

<p>
This has been fixed in the following commit

    babel: no longer overwriting non-babel src blocks
    org-exp-blocks: adding progress-marker local variable
    
      the progress-marker local variable set inside of a let in
      org-exp-blocks is used to constrain searches in org-babel-exp to
      ensure that a babel block doesn't overwrite non-babel src blocks  
</pre>

<p>which introduces a local variable to org-ex-blocks which is used by
org-babel-exp to ensure that previous blocks do not overwrite the
current block.
