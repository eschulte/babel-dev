<p>removed all language lists (`org-babel-interpreters' and
`org-babel-tangle-langs') from Org-babel.  We no longer explicitly
check if languages are on lists of supported languages, but rather
simply check that the appropriate functions
(e.g. `org-babel-execute:sh') are defined at the times when they are
needed.
</p>
<p>
changes
</p><ul>
<li>
Instead of adding anything to external variables, we are going to
rely on the existing header argument system to hold information on
commentability and tangling of languages
</li>
<li>
From now on users will have to explicitly request comments in
tangled code by setting the <code>:comments</code> header argument to <code>yes</code>.
</li>
<li>
We still want to be able to associate languages with file
extensions, now done with `org-babel-tangle-lang-exts'.  This is the
<b>only</b> remaining list of languages used by Org-babel.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that this has got overly complicated; time for some
simplification and harmonisation.
</p>
<p>
See also bug  <a href="#*Language==mappings==in==org==src==lang==modes==should==be==honoured==by==babel">Language mappings in org-src-lang-modes should be honoured by babel</a>
</p>
<p>
-Lets just subvert org-src-lang-modes and use it for everything- (not
actually making any changes to this variable).  It would now hold
</p><ul>
<li>
language major mode
</li>
<li>
language extension
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Then when we need to check whether or not the language <code>lang</code> is
executable we can just see if we have a <code>org-babel-execute:lang</code>
function.
</p>
<p>
This can happen <b>after</b> the merge of our code into the main body of
org-mode to make the shared variable a little bit more natural.
