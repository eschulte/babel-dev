Started: see branch org-icons at git@github.com:dandavison/org-devel.git

I would like to investigate using org-icons to replace the code
block boilerplate (#+begin<sub>src</sub> LANG &hellip; #+end<sub>src</sub>) with nice
language-specific icons. Personally, even with code block
folding, I find the remaining block boilerplate to be a bit
intrusive.
</p>
<p>
As for default icons&hellip;ideas? I don't know what it would look
like using the icons associated with the respective software
projects (ruby, python, R, etc) but it would be interesting to
see.
