<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Thanks to Maurizio for pointing out this error.

<p class="verse">
And these are two test cases. I'm particularly puzzled by the first,<br/>
because the regexp seems to be anchored to the begin of line and hence<br/>
it shouldn't match the begin<sub>src</sub> inside the string.<br/>
For end<sub>src</sub>, it should probably be anchored to the begin of line.<br/>
