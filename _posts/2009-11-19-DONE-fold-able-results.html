<p>
As mentioned in the caching discussion it will often be desirable to
hide results in org-mode buffers.  This should be fairly easily
implemented using the same mechanisms used to fold source-code blocks
in tandem with the `org-babel-result-end' function.
</p>
<p>
this is currently implemented in the head of the ems-babel branch
