A common situation for me is that I return to an org-babel file
containing several blocks with output, and the first thing I want
to do as a sanity check is execute all the blocks, verifying that
the new output is the same as the old output.

Maybe this would be possible if you rename the results, and then
write a lob function which compares two results for equality?  If
you put that idea into a table then you'd basically have our test
suite.  I guess we could also develop support for doing this sort
of thing automatically, although it's not clear to me how you
would indicate that you want to do a "checking" run by default.
I do like the idea however, as it seems like it will have direct
reproducible research applications.  Maybe we just make this a
header argument, and then provide some functions which call
individual or multiple blocks with that header argument pre-set
to true &ndash; or maybe header arguments aren't the appropriate tool
for this situation?
