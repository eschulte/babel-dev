title: TODO How do we check that block output is identical to previous output?
layout: default

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="todo TODO"> TODO</span> How do we check that block output is identical to previous output? </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "TODO"       from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-02-14 Sun 18:24</span></span>

<p>
A common situation for me is that I return to an org-babel file
containing several blocks with output, and the first thing I want
to do as a sanity check is execute all the blocks, verifying that
the new output is the same as the old output.

</ul>
