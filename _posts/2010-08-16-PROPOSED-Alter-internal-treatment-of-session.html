<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="todo PROPOSED"> PROPOSED</span> Alter internal treatment of :session </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "PROPOSED"   from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-08-16 Mon 12:16</span></span>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Would it make sense for `org-babel-get-src-block-info' to look at
the value of the :session param, and if it is "none", then set it
to nil? That would mean that all the other code could simply test
for non-nil :session, and not worry about the possibility
of :session being "none".
