<p>You see that when the language is unknown to Org-babel (<code>Delphi</code> in
this example), it gets ignored during export, and gets replaced by
the previous code block!!
</p>
<p>
So, the current workaround is to take whatever other language know
to Babel (here: <code>perl</code>) for the export to (at least) output the
right code in the generated document (even if not correctly
highlighted).

demonstrated in the attached <a href="data/babel-overwrite.html">babel-overwrite.org</a>
</p>
<p>
Probably has something to do with the conflicting regular expressions
between org-babel-exp.el and org-exp-blocks.el&hellip;
