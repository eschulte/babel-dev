<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="todo PROPOSED"> PROPOSED</span> end results syntax for org formatted results </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<ul>
<li>
State "PROPOSED"   from "" <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2010-08-18 Wed 16:15</span></span>
</li>
</ul>
