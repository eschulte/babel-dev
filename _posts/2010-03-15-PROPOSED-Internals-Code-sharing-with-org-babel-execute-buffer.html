Functions like org-babel-pop-to-session have to go through some
initial variable binding which partially overlaps with the
variable bindings in org-babel-execute-src-block. If possible, it
would be nice to abstract the common set-up into shared code. For
example, I recently added default-directory in the let-binding of
o-b-execute-src-block, and subsequently realised that it also
needed to be added to o-b-pop-to-session.
