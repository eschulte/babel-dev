<p>I want to prevent a block from being evaluated. I'm evaluating the
subtree with C-c C-v s. :eval never throws an error which prevents the
rest of the blocks from being evaluated.

<p>
Yes, these should not throw errors, similarly the <code>:noeval</code> header
argument should be folded into the <code>:eval</code> header argument, something
like "manual".  Maybe <code>:noeval</code> should stick around as an alias for
<code>:eval manual</code>.  Also these header arguments should be documented.
