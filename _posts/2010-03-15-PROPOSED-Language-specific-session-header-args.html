<p>
One may want to specify the session for multiple blocks using
properties. However, currently there is no way to specify a
different session for different languages using properties. Two
possibilities come to mind:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Use org-babel-default-header-args:LANG
</li>
<li>
Introduce new headers of the form session:LANG or session-LANG

<p>
(1) is cleaner, in that it uses existing technology with no
changes. However, it would be nice to be able to set these things
in a property drawer. Perhaps(??) we could have a rule that says
that session:LANG in a property drawer means to set the value of
session in org-babel-default-header-args:LANGORG-LIST-END
