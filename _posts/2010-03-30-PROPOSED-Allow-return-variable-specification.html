<p>In fact, I don't like to put a return statement in the end of the block
just to make babel happy (python included), since I don't want this when I
tangle the file, but this is the most flexible way.
</p>
<p>
Maybe a good feature request for babel it that instead "exports: value" one
has to write "exports: value variable" and this would have the effect of
the "return variable" in the end of the block that we have right now for
python.
</p>
<p>
[Dan] I think this might still suffer from the problem of not knowing
where to insert the "return statement". Because I believe a return
statement will be necessary, whether inserted automatically or not.
