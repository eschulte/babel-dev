* Introduction
  Org-babel might be described as a literate meta-language programming
  environment for Emacs.  It leverages Org-mode for its user interface
  and its ability to export directly to HTML and LaTeX.  It extends
  Org-mode source code blocks by making them executable, with several
  options for handling the results of execution.  Org-babel is
  described by one of its authors as language agnostic; the source
  code blocks in a document can be written in a growing list of
  supported languages.  A document can contain source code blocks in
  as many languages as are needed to complete the task at hand, and
  the results of a source code block in one language can be passed to
  a source code block in another language.  All of this is
  accomplished with a simple syntax and a few easily mastered options.

  This combination of attributes opens up so many use options that the
  possibilities sometimes seem endless.  This document sets out some
  scenarios of Org-babel use.  It is designed to explore a few
  dimensions of Org-babel's use-space, with the hope that others might
  be inspired to explore and share other dimensions of that space.

  The following sections each describe a particular use scenario: the
  problem that it was designed to solve; its software requirements;
  its advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative approaches;
  and a toy example meant to illustrate the structure of the Org-mode
  file and Org-babel's place within it, and not to emulate a
  real-world application.  The initial examples were written primarily
  to explore the uses of LaTeX source code blocks in Org-babel, but a
  multi-language example that mixes LaTeX and R is also included.
  Hopefully, Org-babel users who write in other supported languages
  can supply examples of other work-flows.
  

* Data Collection and Analysis
  This example uses Org-babel to automate a repeated data-collection
  and analysis task.  A Ruby code block is used to scrape data from
  the output of a computational experiment.  This data is then written
  to an Org-mode table.  A block of R code reads from this table and
  calculates lines of fit.  Finally a block of gnuplot code is used to
  graph the results of both the raw data and the R analysis.  By
  performing all of these steps within an Org-mode document working
  notes, discussion, and TODOs can be naturally interspersed with the
  code, and the results can easily be published to HTML or PDF for
  distribution.

** Requirement
   - A working [[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]] installation
   - A working [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] installation
   - A working [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][gnuplot]] installation

** Advantages
   - Org-babel handles passing the data between different programming
     languages
   - Raw data persists in tables in the Org-mode file
   - Working notes can be collocated with the code/results to which
     they refer
   - Tasks can be saved and updated from within the same file in which
     the work is being performed
   - Org-mode exporting facilities can be used to export the results
     to HTML or PDF for distribution

** Disadvantages
   - This approach can allow the experimenter to use whatever language
     is most comfortable for each sub-task, sometimes resulting in an
     overly complicated work flow.  For example, in the example below I
     did not have to learn how to calculate the mean and standard
     deviation in R since it was easier for me to do so in Ruby even
     though a full R solution would have been more efficient.

** Example

*** Code for running experiment and collecting the results

    This portion will not be repeatable as it would require the
    entire experimental setup.  It is provided for demonstration.

    *Ruby* run-timer-test: Runs the actual experiment.  This is
    tangled to an external file and run on the command line -- since
    these runs can take several days, I prefer to run them 
    outside of Emacs (normally using [[http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/][screen]]).
#+srcname: run-timer-test
#+begin_src ruby :results silent :tangle timer :exports code
  DEFAULT_CMDLINE = "--swap 0 --del 0 --mut 0.1 example.c "
  
  def run_and_package(cmdline, package)
    puts "#{package}: ../modify #{cmdline}"
    start_time = Time.now
    %x{../modify #{cmdline}}
    total_time = Time.now - start_time
    %x{echo "wall clock #{total_time}" >> gcd.c-.debug}
    %x{rake package[#{package}]}
  end
  
  100.times do |n|
    # run with default options
    run_and_package(DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "normal_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 2 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_2_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 3 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_3_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 4 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_4_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 5 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_5_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 6 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_6_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 7 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_7_#{n}")
    run_and_package("--pll_fit 8 "+DEFAULT_CMDLINE, "pll_8_#{n}")
  end
#+end_src

    *Ruby* parse-output: The execution of =run-timer-test= leaves
    results distributed across many text log files.  The following
    Ruby source code block is
    used to collect results from these files and dump them into an
    Org-mode file as a table.
#+srcname: parse-output
#+begin_src ruby :results output raw :exports code
  def look(path)
    processors = if path.match(/normal/)
                   "1"
                 elsif path.match(/pll_(\d+)_/)
                   $1
                 else
                   0
                 end
    results = File.read(File.join(path, "gcd.c-.debug"))
    generations =  results.match(/^Generations to solution: (\d+)/) ? Integer($1) : -1
    total = results.match(/^ +TOTAL +([\d\.]+) /) ? Float($1) : -1
    wall = results.match(/^wall clock ([\d\.]+)/) ? Float($1) : -1
    fitness = results.match(/^ +fitness +([\d\.]+) +([\d\.]+) /) ? Float($2) : -1
    mutation = results.match(/^ +mutation +([\d\.]+) +([\d\.]+) /) ? Float($2) : -1
    [path, processors, total, wall, good_test, bad_test, compile, fitness, generations]
  end
  
  # puts "| path | processors | total | wall | fitness | mutation | generations |"
  # puts "|-----------"
  
  Dir.entries('./').select{|e| e.match(/[normalpll]+[_\d]+/)}.
    map{|e| look(e)}.each{|row| puts "| "+row.join(" | ")+" |"}
#+end_src

*** Data
    Here is fake example output from the =parse-output= Ruby source
    code block above.

*** Analysis
    The code blocks in this section will be repeatable as they rely on
    the fake data given above.

    *Ruby* calculate mean and standard deviation over the second column
#+srcname: stddev
#+begin_src ruby :var raw=example-data :results raw output :exports code
  by_procs = {}
  raw.each do |row|
    by_procs[row[1]] ||= []
    by_procs[row[1]] << row[3]
  end

  by_procs.each do |key, vals|
    mean = vals.inject(0){|sum, n| sum + n} / vals.size
    stddev = Math.sqrt(vals.inject(0){|sum, n| sum + ((n - mean).abs * (n - mean).abs)} / vals.size)
    puts "| #{key} | #{mean} | #{stddev} |"
  end
#+end_src

#+results: example-stddev
| 1 |       64.1517638 | 75.1190856698136 |
| 2 | 14.8874693333333 | 18.2514689828405 |
| 3 |       17.6483815 | 14.9070317402304 |
| 4 | 43.0102596666667 | 42.1863032424348 |

    *R* find the curve that best fits these data
#+begin_src R :session R :exports code :var data=example-stddev :results output
  procs <- data$V1
  times <- data$V2
  df <- data.frame(procs, times)
  nlsfit <- nls(times~c0 + (load/procs), data=df, start=list(load = 100, c0 = 20))
  summary(nlsfit)
#+end_src

#+results:
#+begin_example
Formula: times ~ c0 + (load/procs)

Parameters:
     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
load    45.70      36.71   1.245    0.339
c0      11.12      21.90   0.508    0.662

Residual standard error: 21.36 on 2 degrees of freedom

Number of iterations to convergence: 1 
Achieved convergence tolerance: 3.924e-08
#+end_example

    *gnuplot* plot the raw data, along with the error bars and the best
    fit curve
#+begin_src gnuplot :var data=example-data :var mydata=example-stddev :exports code
  set xrange [0.5:5]
  set yrange [0:]
  set ylabel "seconds"
  set xlabel "processes"
  plot data using 2:4 with points title 'raw' linecolor 8
  replot mydata using 1:2:3 with errorbars title 'error' linecolor 1
  replot 11.12 + 45.70/x title 'fit'
#+end_src

    Which produces the following [[file:example-graph.pdf]]

*** Distribution
    Using Org-mode's exporting capabilities it is easy to publish the
    entire working file including source-code and raw data, to share
    sections using `org-narrow-to-subtree', or even to share
    individual tables or graphs.


* A LaTeX Form
  This example uses Org-babel as a user interface for a LaTeX form
  that might be used by the members of an organization.  It uses the
  literate programming facility of Org-babel to isolate the user from
  the sometimes arcane LaTeX constructs needed to create a
  highly-structured form.  Org-babel can tangle multiple documents in
  a single Org-mode file, and this ability is used to create a
  distribution version of the form separate from one designed for the
  file cabinet.

** Requirement
   - A working LaTeX installation.

** Advantages
   - User is isolated from the LaTeX code and thus less likely to
     alter it inadvertently.
   - Multiple versions of the document are created automatically.
   - Org-mode keywords can help track data entry progress.

** Disadvantages
   - This approach is somewhat dated.  A modern organization might
     accomplish this more cleanly with a web-based interface to a database.

** Example

*** TODO Your name
    - Enter your full name on the open line below.
#+srcname: your-name
#+begin_src latex
Tom Dye
#+end_src

*** TODO Your email address
    - Enter your email address on the open line below.
#+srcname: your-email
#+begin_src latex
tsd at tsdye dot com
#+end_src

*** No data entry below this line
    - The two source blocks here each produce a LaTeX document after
      they are tangled with a call to =org-babel-tangle=.

#+begin_src latex :noweb :tangle dist-form.tex 
  \documentclass[12pt]{article}
  \begin{document}
  \section{Distribution Form}
  \begin{description}
  \item[Name] <<your-name>>
  \item[Email] <<your-email>>
  \end{description}
  \end{document}
#+end_src

#+begin_src latex :noweb :tangle file-form.tex 
  \documentclass[10pt]{article}
  \begin{document}
  \section{File Form}
  <<your-name>> can be reached at <<your-email>>.
  \end{document}
#+end_src


* A Standardized Short Report
  This example is similar to the previous one, but here the users are
  expected to write substantial content.  This type of workflow might
  be used by a small organization whose employees regularly produce
  standard documents and where the writing tasks for any one document
  are divided among the authors.  

  The HTML export facility of Org-mode is used to produce a guide to
  writing the standardized short report.  This HTML file can be used
  to train new authors.  The Org-mode content also supplies
  substantial direction to experienced authors as they write.
  Org-mode keywords and tags are used to keep track of writing
  assignments and progress.  Org-babel's literate programming facility
  makes it possible to present writing tasks to the authors in an order
  different from which they appear in the report.

** Requirement
   - A working LaTeX installation.

** Advantages
   - The integration of training material with in-file instruction can
     be quite effective.
   - Many authors find it easy to work from the bottom up, or from the
     particular to the general, rather than the usual sequence of
     general-particular-general found in reports.

** Disadvantages
   - Some features of reftex are not yet integrated into the source
     code block editor, so writing and editing are sometimes less
     convenient than writing to the LaTeX document directly.

** Example
   - This report must satisfy the requirements set out in [[http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/hpd/pdfs/revproc_har/275_284/pdfs/278.pdf][the Historic
     Preservation Division rule]].
   - Complete each of the TODO items.
   - Mark each item DONE when you have completed it.
   - =C-c a t= will make an agenda of items left to do in this
     document.
   - =C-c a m= YOURNAME will make an agenda of writing tasks assigned
     to you.

* A Research Project
  It is outrageous to think that an entire research project might fit
  in a single computer file.  Practically speaking, it probably isn't
  possible.  But the combination of Org-mode and Org-babel does make
  it possible for one file to hold many, many things useful to the researcher:
     - the project schedule; 
     - a daily log; 
     - notes; 
     - a facility to track data acquisition graphically; 
     - a complete specification of the steps taken in data analysis; 
     - the two presentation products typically produced by researchers---an article
       for print publication and a digital slide show; 
     - comments; 
     - metadata;
     - etc.
  
  When the project is finished and the Org-mode file is complete, one
  call to =org-babel-tangle= produces the LaTeX source files for the
  print publication and the Beamer slide show.  Exporting the Org-mode
  file, say with =C-c, C-e h=, produces an HTML file that meets most,
  if not all, the requirements for a piece of reproducible research.

  Equally outrageous---the one Org-mode file is easy to
  set-up, use, and maintain.  A modicum of organization, along with some
  judicious use of keywords and tags, and perhaps a custom agenda item
  or two, makes it easy to keep track of progress and to get where you
  want to be with no hassle.

  More outrageous---the project data can be augmented or
  corrected at any point and these changes will be reflected
  everywhere---in the graphics, the slides, the text of the article,
  the metadata, etc.  One can work with great confidence, knowing that
  mistakes of logic, analysis, and execution are very likely to be
  recorded in the Org-mode file.  Fixing an error where it occurs, and
  only there, propagates the fix throughout the project.  As a result,
  the researcher spends time thinking about the research, rather than
  its organization across multiple directories, files, and
  applications.  What fun!

** Requirements
   - A working LaTeX installation.
   - A working R installation.
   - Note that this example is an illustration only.  It is not fully
     functional as it stands.

** Advantages
   - Easier and more efficient error checking and correction.
   - On-the-fly production of reproducible research document.
   - Comprehensive log of data analysis.

** Disadvantages
   - Some features of reftex are not yet integrated into the source
     code block editor, so writing and editing are sometimes less
     convenient than writing to the LaTeX document directly.

** Example
   This example shows snippets from an on-going project.  It
   represents a first attempt to integrate Org-babel with a research
   project. 

   The schedule and daily log use Org-mode functionality in a fairly
   simple way.  More sophisticated setups are certainly possible and
   probably useful.

   Org-babel is used to monitor data acquisition and in particular to
   catch data entry errors as they happen.  It is also used
   extensively in the data analysis, which provides a simple example
   of how it might be used.

*** Schedule
   

**** DONE Meet Jenny to measure adzes
     DEADLINE: <2009-11-25 Wed 14:00>
     :LOGBOOK:
     - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-11-25 Wed 20:18]
     :END:


**** TODO Regress edge width on weight 
     DEADLINE: <2009-11-27 Fri>

*** Daily Log
**** 09/11/25
     - Measured adzes in trays 2 and 3.  
     - Reworked measurement protocol for shoulder thickness on untanged adzes.

**** 09/11/26
     - Checked shoulder thickness measures on untanged adzes.  All OK now.

*** Data Acquisition

    - This section illustrates the use of Org-babel to track data
      acquisition.  Queries are designed to expose unlikely data
      values likely to be the result of data entry errors.  These
      queries are collected in a source code block that establishes an
      R session, reads data from the database, and creates R data
      objects and graphics that can be used diagnostically.

**** Queries
    - Source code block r-bad-interior-landmarks checks for data entry
      errors in the presence/absence of landmarks.  Note that if the
      edge is present and the poll is present that the shoulder and
      chin must be present, as well.  This query assumes that the
      observations on chin and poll have been entered correctly.

#+srcname: r-bad-interior-landmarks
#+begin_src R
      bad.landmarks <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from adze where
      edge_present = 'true' AND poll_present = 'true' AND (shoulder_present
      = 'false' OR chin_present = 'false')")
#+end_src
      
      - Plot weight to look for unusual weights.  In practice any
        diagnostic plot that isolates outliers can be used to check
        for possible data entry errors.

#+srcname: r-complete-weight-histogram
#+begin_src R 
  adze.wt <- ggplot(whole.adze, aes(weight))
  adze.wt + geom_histogram(fill="white",color="black") +
  scale_x_log10()
  ggsave(file = "adze_wt_log.pdf", width = 5, height = 3)
#+end_src

#+resname: r-complete-weight-histogram
[[http://www.tsdye2.com/org-babel/adze_wt_log.pdf][file:adze_wt_log.pdf]]

 
**** Set-up Session

     - Run r-data-acquisition to refresh the output of the data
       acquisition queries.  This is the highest-level source code
       block.  It establishes an R session named acquire, loads
       various R libraries, and populates the session with data
       objects based on database queries.  The source code block
       =<<r-complete-2>>= is defined in the following section to
       create an R data frame of all the complete adzes in the database.
       Then, the two source code blocks defined above are run on that
       data frame to produce (hopefully) useful diagnostics.

#+src_name r-data-acquisition
#+begin_src R :session acquire :noweb
  library(ggplot2)
  library(xtable)
  <<r-connect>>
  <<r-complete-2>>
  <<r-bad-interior-landmarks>>
  <<r-complete-weight-histogram>>
#+end_src

  - The r-connect source code block can be used by other source code
    blocks.  It is used in r-data-acquisition (above) and in
    r-data-analysis (below).  The fictitious code shown here
    illustrates an R connection to a database server.
#+srcname: r-connect
#+begin_src R
  library(RMySQL)
  con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user="me", password="mine", dbname="adze", host="localhost")
#+end_src

*** Data Analysis
    - This section illustrates how queries can be documented and
      revised.  A simple table is developed for use in the print
      publication and the Beamer slide show.

**** Querying for Complete Adzes
   - The first try was r-complete, which relies on a single field, *complete*, in
     the data table.  In practice, an adze blade that is substantially
     complete, but whose edge has been chipped away, would be
     classified as complete because all of the attributes typically
     recorded are present.  For certain measures, such as length, this
     might introduce a bit of bias.

#+srcname: r-complete
#+begin_src R
 complete.adze <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from adze where complete = 'complete'")
#+end_src

 - A second try is somewhat more satisfying because it relies on
   direct observation that the edge is present along with the poll.
   For length measurements, for instance, it is a direct statement to
   the effect that the full length of the blade was measured.

#+srcname: r-complete-2
#+begin_src R
 whole.adze <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from adze where edge_present = 'true' AND poll_present = 'true'")
#+end_src

**** Making a Table

     - Here, the xtable package is used to return a LaTeX table of
       values corresponding to the range, median, and 0.25 quantiles
       of the adze blade weights.  This can be inserted directly into
       a LaTeX source block, or it can be saved to a file with the
       xtable print() function.  The file solution is attractive
       because the table can be tweaked after it is written and
       subsequent tangles, if necessary, will not overwrite it.  On
       the other hand, it might be best to tweak the table after the
       document is completely stable and doesn't need re-tangling.
       The output of xtable is certainly useful in draft documents.
       The R source block r-weight-quantile is designed to insert its
       results directly in the LaTeX file.  The source block can be
       debugged by checking that its :results output latex is a valid
       LaTeX construct.

#+srcname: r-weight-quantile
#+begin_src R :session adze :results output
   weight <- quantile(whole.adze$weight)
   weight.xtable <- xtable(as.data.frame(weight))
   caption(weight.xtable) <- 'Weights of complete adzes in the Bishop
   Museum collection.'
   label(weight.xtable) <- 'tab:weight_xtable'
   print(weight.xtable, file="weight_xtable.tex", table.placement =
   "htb!", caption.placement = "top")
#+end_src

#+resname: r-weight-quantile
% latex table generated in R 2.9.2 by xtable 1.5-5 package

\begin{table}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\caption{Weights of complete adzes in the Bishop
Museum collection.}
\label{tab:weight_xtable}
\begin{tabular}{rr}
  \hline
 & weight \\ 
  \hline
0\% &   0 \\ 
  25\% &  22 \\ 
  50\% &  34 \\ 
  75\% &  83 \\ 
  100\% & 2580 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

*** Presentation of Results

    - Org-babel and Org-mode make it convenient to develop a slide
      show and a print publication side-by-side.  The literate
      programming facility of Org-babel makes it easy to divide each
      of the presentations up into small chunks.  Sometimes, writing
      the slide helps the mind focus on what should appear in the
      print publication.  Other times, writing out the print
      publication helps define what should appear in the slide.

**** Introduction

 The introduction needs to set up the problem: adzes have been
  classified according to putatively culture-historical
  characteristics, the goal of which is to create classes of artifact
  that have distinctive space-time distributions. In Dunnell's terms,
  these must be stylistic classes. But, Turner's work in NZ has
  shown that the classes thus formed are actually functional.  Thus,
  they aren't appropriate for culture history.  The problem is that
  they are poorly specified for functional studies.  We want to
  develop a specifically functional classification.

  - The LaTeX introduction.  Compare this with the introductory Beamer
    slide below.

  \section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:introduction}
  
  The traditional archaeological classification of Polynesian stone
  adzes, based on the work of
  \citet{duff56:_moa_hunter_period_of_maori_cultur}, no longer serves a
  useful purpose.  Duff's classification, based on the shape of the
  cross-section, was designed for culture historical study:
  
  \begin{quote} the peculiarities in the distribution of adze types
    over the scattered island groups of Polynesia are due less to the
    nature or needs of the environment than to the successive growth,
    diffusion, and replacement of cultural patterns.  The practical
    layman, contrasting a `hog-backed' with a `side-hafted' adze,
    might object that each was so shaped for specific purpose, and
    that their distribution must be due to that purpose.  These two

**** Results
 In this section a table and a graphic generated earlier are inserted
 into the LaTeX document.  The table is
 inserted directly, while the graphic is inserted using its pdf file
 representation.

 - The LaTeX results source code block.  Note the references to the
   <<r-weight-quantile>> table and to the adz_wt_log.pdf file created
   above.
