* Notes                                                            :noexport:
** Template Design
  - What the user wants to know:
    - Required software
    - How to install it
    - How to configure it in Org-babel
    - Org-babel conventions that might affect the language
    - How it modifies Org-babel
    - Common ways to use it
** Queries
   - Eric, I think you should name your starter kit Literate Emacs
     Starter Kit (LESK).  I've taken the liberty of labeling the link
     to it that way below.  Is that OK?
   - I think LESK is a couple of steps away from being useful to Lisp
     illiterates (like me).  I'm thinking of LESK for Lisp
     IlliteraTEs, or LESK LITE.  Is that anathema?
 
** Comments
   - I'm not sure how you two use tags.  I've used :Fix on Dan's
     Graphical output, because I think it should be parceled out to
     various sections of the template, and not because I think it
     needs fixing in and of itself.

* Requirements                                                       :Update:
** [[http://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs Speaks Statistics]] 
   Required for session-based evaluation.
*** Installation using  [[http://github.com/eschulte/emacs-starter-kit/tree/master][Literate Emacs Starter Kit]]                    :Write:
    - unpack ess-VERSION.tgz in .emacs.d/src
    - for me, this created ess-5.6, need an alias named ess?
    - where to put (require 'ess-site)?
* Configuration in Org-babel                                          :Write:
** Variables
* Language-specific Features 					      :Write:
** Missing Values
** Graphical output 							:Fix:
    If a =:file filename.ext= header arg is provided to an R block,
    then all graphical output from the source block is captured on
    disk, and the output of the source block is a link to the
    resulting file (as is also the case with the graphics-only
    languages such as gnuplot, ditaa, dot, asymptote.)

    An attempt is made to find an R graphics device corresponding to
    the file extension (currently .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, .bmp,
    .pdf, .ps, .postscript are recognised); if that fails, png format
    output is created.
    
    Additionally, values for several arguments to the R graphics
    device can be passed using header args:
    
#+begin_example 
    :width :height :bg :units :pointsize :antialias :quality :compression :res :type :family
    :title :fonts :version :paper :encoding :pagecentre :colormodel :useDingbats :horizontal
#+end_example
    
    See the R help page for the graphics devices (e.g. using =?png=,
    =?pdf=) for explanations of these arguments.

    Arguments to the R graphics device that are not supported as header
    args can be passed as a string in R argument syntax, using the header
    arg =:R-dev-args=
    
    An example block is (although both bg and fg can be passed directly as
    header args)
    
#+begin_example 
    #+begin_src R :file z.pdf :width 8 :height 8 :R-dev-args bg="olivedrab", fg="hotpink"
      plot(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol=2), type="l")
    #+end_src
#+end_example

* Tips for usage
** Debugging
   This section contains some tips on how to proceed if your R code is
   not doing what you had hoped.
*** Use =:session=
    Evaluate your code using the =:session= header argument, then
    visit the R buffer (i.e. the buffer containing the "inferior ESS"
    process). Then you can inspect the objects that have been created,
    and try out some lines of code. Useful R functions for inspecting
    objects include (as always in R, type a "?" followed by the name
    of the function to get help with the function)
    - str
    - dim
    - summary
*** Use ESS to step through evaluation line-by-line
    1. Use C-c ' to visit the edit buffer for your code block
    2. Use ess-eval-line-and-step to evaluate each line in turn

In addition to ess-eval-line-and-step, there are several other ESS
functions with names beginning ess-eval-*. They evaluate lines and
regions in different ways; it's worth looking at their descriptions
(C-h f).
    
** Outputting latex code from R
This example summarises a linear regression fit. Usually the org-babel
user should not have to be involved in latex code generation, as this
is the responsibility of org-mode's latex export engine. But in this
example, neither the printed representation nor the value of
summary(lm(y ~ x)) is at all tabular, and it would therefore require
some work to get the information in to an org table. However, the
xtable package can be used to output a latex table. Using ':results
latex' in org-babel ensures that this is stored as a latex block in
the org buffer and thus can be included correctly in latex-based
export targets.

#+begin_src R :results output latex
library(xtable)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
xtable(summary(lm(y ~ x)))
#+end_src

#+results:

** ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS
   When in an org mode R code edit buffer with an associated R
   session, ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS will bring the R session buffer
   into view and place point at the prompt. ESS binds this to C-c C-z
   and C-M-r by default.
