* Abstract
  We present a new computing environment for reproducible research and
  literate programming. In this environment a single
  hierarchically-organised plain text source file may contain a
  variety of elements such as source code, numerical data, links to
  images and other files, project management data, working notes, and
  text for publication. Source code fragments may be executed in situ
  with graphical and text output being captured in, or linked to from,
  the source file. Export to \LaTeX, HTML and other formats permits
  working reports, presentations and manuscripts for publication to be
  generated from the source file. In addition, source code extraction
  (tangling) permits functioning pure code files to be extracted from
  their native environment. This framework is implemented as an
  extension to the Emacs text editor and additionally provides a very
  rich set of features for working with the source file, including
  sophisticated project management capabilities.

* Introduction
*** The problem addressed
  Research projects can be described as comprising the following stages:
1. A question or problem is identified
2. Possible approaches to an answer or solution are conceived of.
3. Initial implementations are made.
4. A phase follows of alternating testing and refinement of the solution
5. A preferred solution is finally identified
6. The results are written up and disseminated.

Traditionally, these stages are represented by changes in several
different computer files or other records containing working notes,
computer code, test output and pre-publication manuscripts. One of the
challenges in carrying out such work is simply that of maintaining a
clear picture of the current state and direction of the project.
